# Dupe: mono-to-stereo widener

![One does not simply turn a mono signal into stereo](.github/images/one_does_not_simply.jpg)

A JUCE audio plugin that turns a mono source (typically a guitar or vocal) into a wide stereo image while staying perfectly mono-compatible. Two micro pitch-shifters detune the input by ±`Pitch` cents; their decorrelated difference forms a pure side signal, while the dry input stays as the mid. The output is constructed as `L = dry + width·side`, `R = dry − width·side`, so summing `(L+R)/2` collapses back to the dry signal exactly: no comb filtering, no level drop, no chorusing on mono. An optional Haas-style precedence delay on one of the wet branches broadens the image further without breaking mono compatibility.

Parameters: `Pitch` (0–40 cents, default 7), `Mix` (0–1, default 1.0; scales the side gain up to 4× internally), `Haas` (0–30 ms, default 0), `Mono Listen` (sums output to mono in-plugin, useful for verifying mono compatibility).

Built on the [Starty](https://github.com/vberthiaume/starty) template, which itself derives from [Pamplejuce](https://github.com/sudara/pamplejuce).

## Install dependencies
### macOS
```bash
brew install cmake ninja clang-format          # Homebrew: https://brew.sh
```

### Linux (Ubuntu / Debian)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
  cmake ninja-build clang clang-format lld \
  libasound2-dev libx11-dev libxinerama-dev libxext-dev \
  libfreetype6-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
```

### Windows
- **[CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)** (add to PATH during install).
- **[Ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases)** on PATH (or `choco install ninja`).

## Install the pre-commit hook
One-time, per clone. Refuses commits whose staged C/C++ files aren't clang-format clean (see `.githooks/pre-commit`):

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

## Build (and run tests)
```bash
cmake -B Builds -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
cmake --build Builds
ctest --test-dir Builds --output-on-failure
```

For a universal macOS binary, add `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="arm64;x86_64"` to the configure step.

## Run RTSan locally (macOS)
CI runs RealtimeSanitizer on Linux. To check locally on macOS, install Homebrew LLVM, since Apple Clang doesn't ship the RTSan runtime:
```bash
brew install llvm
```

Configure a separate build dir using brew's clang and the realtime flags:
```bash
CC=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang \
CXX=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang++ \
cmake -B Builds-rtsan -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-fsanitize=realtime" \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fsanitize=realtime" \
  -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-fsanitize=realtime"
```

Build and run:
```bash
cmake --build Builds-rtsan --target Tests
ctest --test-dir Builds-rtsan --output-on-failure --verbose -E NOT_BUILT
```

## CI
Every push and PR triggers:
- `build_and_test`: Linux/macOS/Windows, `pluginval` validation, artifact upload
- `instrumented_tests`: ASan / UBSan / TSan / RTSan (clang-20 for the latter), plus a Coverage report (gcovr → HTML artifact + step-summary numbers)
- `clang-tidy`: posts review comments on PRs

`nightly.yml` is wired up but its `schedule:` block is currently commented out, since push-driven CI is enough while development is active. Re-enable the cron in that file once the project is in maintenance mode and external drift (JUCE on `develop`, apt packages, runner images) becomes the main breakage risk.

## Releasing
Releases are tag-driven. The `release` job in `build_and_test.yml` is gated on `contains(github.ref, 'tags/v')` and uses `softprops/action-gh-release` to publish build artifacts (`.exe`, `.zip`, `.pkg`) as a GitHub prerelease.

To cut a release:
1. On a release branch, update the `VERSION` file in the repo root (e.g. `0.1.0`).
2. Open a PR against `main` and get it merged.
3. Pull the merged commit locally, then tag it with a `v`-prefixed tag matching the version and push the tag:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git tag v0.1.0
   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```
4. CI runs the full matrix on the tag, then the `release` job picks up the artifacts and publishes a draft prerelease on GitHub. Open the Releases page, fill in the description, flip the prerelease flag off if it's a real release, and publish.

The `v` prefix is required; a bare `0.1.0` tag won't trigger the release job.
